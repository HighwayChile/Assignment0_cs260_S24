Assignment 0 for Spring 2024, CS260, LBCC  

Hello, I have been brushing up on my C skills and the stuff in the source files 
here are just the basics! Thank you!  


# Interesting Computing Topics  

1. AI -  
AI is the most front-facing computing topic at the moment.  

2. Parsing language -  
It is very interesting, to me, the process of turning language into data and using that data to 
convey the user's intent to the machine.  

3. Data storage solutions -  
IMO the cloud is a slippery slope, and we can do better (the physical storage is still needed, somewhere). If there is a Moore's law for data storage, that interests me.  
P.S. the "cloud" is not the problem, it's the current implementation.  

4. Open source initiatives/right to repair -  [WSJ Right to repair(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NCjoUx-KLI)
I put these together because the ones who fight right to repair are always fighting open source resources.  

5. Recursion  


# Five Difficult Computing Topics  

1. Pointers-  
Pointers are not too confusing to me, but using them in linked lists is a challenge.  

2. Decomposition -  
In the past, I have written functions that did two things, and the way I had it interacting with the rest of my code made it difficult to 
decompose that function. I also need practice decomposing my functions completely, when applicable. That is to move the function into their own source file(not always useful).  

3. Planning/Design -  
I find this to be one of the most challenging steps. There are times when I don't actually know what I want, until I have tried something.  

4. How data is stored in practice -  
The way in which data is stored is logical, but complex.  

5. Some of the bare-bones knowledge -  
I lack some of the knowledge needed to smoothly write, compile, debug, and run my code. I can do all of those things, but I invariably have some hiccups along the way. For example: It took me a really long time to find out that I needed to type 'g++' instead of 'gcc' to compile my .cpp file using mingw. Another example: I was using Valgrind to sus out memory leaks in a program and I was beating my head against the wall for over an hour trying to use windows commands in a linux shell. There were also some issues with folder names in linux, but I had enough experience to immediately notice those. Interesting.
